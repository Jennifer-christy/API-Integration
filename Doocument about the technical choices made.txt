->I have designed a Recipe website.
-> In this website I have used Font Awesome for Icons and Google Fonts for Fonts.
->The recipe data (Meal API) is fetched from the 'The MealDB' website.
->We can search the Recipes by typing the Recipe Name(ex.cake, pizza) or primary ingredient(ex.beef, chicken,egg) in the search bar.
-> Once the recipes are listed out you can get the recipe instruction by clicking on the get recipe button.
